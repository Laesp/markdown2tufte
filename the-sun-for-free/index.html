<h1>Can I get a free copy of The Sun?</h1>
<p>I read <a href="http://thesunmagazine.org/"><em>The Sun</em></a>. Its a great publication, generally neutral with an open-minded acceptance to all sorts of writing. One of the most exciting parts is the <a href="http://thesunmagazine.org/about/submission_guidelines/readers_write">Reader’s Write</a>, which is best explained by The Sun:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Readers Write asks readers to address subjects on which they’re the only authorities. Writing style isn’t as important as thoughtfulness and sincerity. We publish only nonfiction in Readers Write.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>One of the things about submitting to the Readers Write is that if they use the piece, The Sun will grant you a complimentary one-year subscription!</p>
<p>The Sun publishes only once a month, so we got to thinking, “<em>How long would it take to get a entry into the Sun?</em>”. In order to determine this, I’m going to enter a nonfiction writing piece every month and see how many months it takes to get it.</p>
